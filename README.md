report_type = "weekly"

[smtp]
host = "smtp.example.com"
port = 587
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
from = "reports@example.com"
skip_tls_verify = false
tls = true

[websites.example]
disabled = true
base_url = "https://analytics.example.com"
id = "e97f683e-12e8-4fb5-970b-f5171804fe21"
